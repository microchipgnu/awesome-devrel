# Awesome DX (Developer Experience)

I recently took the role as Head of DevRel at [Mintbase](https://mintbase.io). This is my personal take on what's interesting and relevant for any Developer Relations and Developer Experience role as I'm learning and getting more experienced.

## What is DX?

> Tools that keep developers in the flow state have a magnetic force. An often unexplainable, invisible pull that attracts and retains them to certain products. This pull is developer experience (DX)

## DX vs DevRel

> There's a lot of debate about the proper terminology for what we currently refer to as "DevRel." Many folks are happy with this terminology, but I and others don't think DevRel (developer relations) is a broad enough term to represent what our field has become over the last half-decade.

> At Vercel, Developer Experience is a superset of Developer Relations (which is focused on building community and advocating for the product) and Documentation.
